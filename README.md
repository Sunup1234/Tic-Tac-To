# Tic-Tac-To

Game Project realised using the thinker package in python.

I first made the thinker window with the right dimensions and added buttons to it (3X3).

I then added different functions to make the game playable (Place symbol function, win check, replay game, review game...)

It was a really fun project to make, and it made me use graphical interfaces in python for the first time.
